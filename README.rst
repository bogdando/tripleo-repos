dlrn-repo
=========

A tool for managing dlrn repos.

See: https://github.com/openstack-packages/DLRN

Note that this is intended as a tool for bootstrapping the repo setup in
things like TripleO, so it should not have any runtime OpenStack dependencies
or we end up in a chicken-and-egg pickle, and let's be honest - no one wants a
chicken and egg pickle.
